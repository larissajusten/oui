# Abeto.co Color System Documentation

---

## 1.0 Overview

### 1.1 Philosophy

This color system is inspired by the whimsical aesthetic of Studio Ghibli's "Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea." The palette is built on the narrative duality between the magical, energetic **Sea (Ponyo)** and the warm, stable **Land (Sﾅ行uke)**. This distinction forms the core of our UI's visual language, creating an intuitive user experience.

### 1.2 Core Principles

* **Thematic & Whimsical**: Colors are chosen to evoke the hand-painted, natural feeling of the film.
* **Accessibility First**: All primary color combinations are designed to meet or exceed WCAG AA standards.
* **Clear Hierarchy**: Colors have defined roles. Ponyo's palette is for **actions**, and Sﾅ行uke's is for **information**.
* **Maintainable**: The system is built on a structured set of SCSS variables for easy implementation and maintenance.

## 2.0 Palette Specification

### 2.1 Light Theme (Land & Shore) 沁ｨ

The light theme is designed to feel airy, warm, and inviting, like Sﾅ行uke's house on the cliff overlooking the sea.

| Role | Color Name | Hex | SCSS Variable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | Warm Sand | `#F9F7F5` | `$ouiPageBackgroundColor` |
| **Primary Text** | Driftwood Brown | `#3D352E` | `$ouiColorDarkestShade` |
| **Primary Action** | Deep Sea Blue | `#2B546A` | `$ouiColorPrimary` |
| **CTA / Accent** | Ponyo's Coral | `#F9627D` | `$ouiColorAccent` |
| **Info Surface** | Sﾅ行uke's Yellow | `#F7B538` | `$ouiColorWarning` |
| **Grounding Surface** | Cliffside Green | `#5F826E` | `$ouiColorSecondary` |
| **Borders**| Pebble Gray| `#D1CFCB`| `$ouiColorLightShade`|

### 2.2 Dark Theme (Deep Sea) 沍

The dark theme is moody and magical, inspired by the depths of the ocean. Colors are made more vibrant to ensure high contrast and energy.

| Role | Color Name | Hex | SCSS Variable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | Deepest Sea | `#11202C` | `$ouiPageBackgroundColor`|
| **Primary Text** | Ocean Foam | `#F5F5F3` | `$ouiColorFullShade` |
| **Primary Action** | Magic Blue | `#36A2EB` | `$ouiColorPrimary` |
| **CTA / Accent** | Ponyo's Coral | `#F9627D` | `$ouiColorAccent` |
| **Info Surface** | Sﾅ行uke's Yellow | `#F7B538` | `$ouiColorWarning` |
| **Grounding Surface** | Magic Seafoam | `#4ECFA2` | `$ouiColorSecondary` |
| **Card Surface**| Deep Sea Ink| `#182C3B`| `$ouiColorEmptyShade`|

## 3.0 Implementation & Usage Directives

### 3.1 Accessibility Directive: CTA Contrast

To maintain WCAG AA compliance, a specific rule must be followed for the primary accent color.

* **Rule:** Any button or interactive surface using `Ponyo's Coral` (`$ouiColorAccent`) as a background **MUST** use a dark text color, such as `Driftwood Brown` (`$ouiColorDarkestShade` in the light theme).

### 3.2 Advanced Effects: Shadows & Transparency

Standard palette colors are opaque. To create natural-looking effects like shadows, transparent versions of the palette colors must be used.

* **Best Practice:** Derive transparent colors directly from the core SCSS variables to maintain system consistency.

* **Example Implementation (`sea-sparkle-shadow`):**
    ```scss
    // Create transparent versions from our main palette
    $sea-blue-shadow-color: rgba($ouiColorPrimary, 0.2);
    $gold-sparkle-color: rgba($ouiColorWarning, 0.5);

    // Create a reusable mixin for the effect
    @mixin sea-sparkle-shadow {
      box-shadow:
        0 5px 15px -3px $sea-blue-shadow-color,
        -2px -1px 8px -4px $gold-sparkle-color;
    }
    ```

## 4.0 Known Issues & Limitations

### 4.1 Build System Challenges

When integrating this customized OUI fork with OpenSearch Dashboards, several technical challenges may arise:

#### 4.1.1 TypeScript Configuration Requirements

**Issue:** The OUI build process may fail due to TypeScript type conflicts, particularly with Babel type definitions (`@types/babel__traverse`) showing syntax errors like `TS1005: '?' expected`.

**Workaround:** Add `"skipLibCheck": true` to the `compilerOptions` section of `tsconfig.json` in both the OUI fork and OpenSearch Dashboards repositories. This bypasses third-party type definition checking while maintaining type safety for your own code.

#### 4.1.2 Dependency Version Conflicts (_I think at this point claude was lost_)

**Issue:** Multiple version ranges for dependencies (particularly `@elastic/eui` vs `@opensearch-project/oui`) may be declared across different `package.json` files in OpenSearch Dashboards, causing bootstrap failures.

**Resolution:** All `package.json` files must reference the same version. Use the following command to update all references:
```bash
find . -type f -name package.json -exec sed -i '' 's/"@opensearch-project\/oui": ".*"/"@elastic\/eui": "file:\/path\/to\/oui-fork"/g' {} \;
```

Pay special attention to `@osd/ui-framework` and `@osd/ui-shared-deps` packages, which may require manual updates.

#### 4.1.3 React Type Definition Incompatibilities (_Also kind of lost, cause the problema actually was other_)

**Issue:** During webpack compilation, you may encounter errors about React components not being valid JSX elements (e.g., `AutosizeInput`, `FixedSizeList`, `DragDropContext` showing "Property 'refs' is missing").

**Cause:** Conflicting React type definitions from different packages (particularly from `@types/enzyme` and the main `@types/react`).

**Mitigation:** The `skipLibCheck: true` setting addresses this issue by preventing TypeScript from strictly validating third-party type definitions.

#### 4.1.4 Missing Babel Dependencies

**Issue:** Initial builds may fail with `Cannot find module '@babel/core'` errors during the `extract-i18n-strings` step.

**Resolution:** Ensure all dependencies are properly installed:
```bash
yarn install
# If issues persist, explicitly install Babel dependencies:
yarn add --dev @babel/core @babel/cli
```

### 4.2 Integration Best Practices

#### 4.2.1 Local Development Setup

When linking a local OUI fork to OpenSearch Dashboards:

1. **Build OUI first** with all modifications in place
2. **Disable rebuild scripts** in OUI's `package.json` to prevent OpenSearch Dashboards from attempting to rebuild:
   ```json
   "build": "echo 'Build already completed, skipping'",
   "prepare": "echo 'Skipping prepare'"
   ```
3. Clean OpenSearch Dashboards completely before linking:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
   ```

### 4.3 Limitations

* **Type Safety Trade-offs:** Using `skipLibCheck` reduces type safety for third-party libraries. Ensure thorough testing of component integrations.
* **Bootstrap Complexity:** The OpenSearch Dashboards bootstrap process is sensitive to dependency versions. Fresh installs are recommended when switching OUI versions.
* **Git Workflow:** If working from a cloned repository without forking first, changes must be committed locally before creating a fork and pushing to your own remote.
